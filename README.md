This extension automatically unchecks the *Notify watchers* checkbox when you edit pages on [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) (or checks the *Minor change* checkbox for older versions of Confluence), making sure no unintended emails will ever be sent again.

If you ever worked with Confluence, you know how annoying it is to click on that little checkbox before sending any modifications you made to a page. You also know how it's even more annoying when you forget to do that and billions (I said billions!) of people receive an email from you about the change you just made ("Lil John just changed a comma on that page nobody reads. You're very welcome.").

This is a life changer.
